            <h2>Pride and Prejudice</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate
                    which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of
                    the table, by her ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing
                    greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended,
                    first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law
                    said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed
                    gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on
                    the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready
                    to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the
                    former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
                    dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing
                    her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the
                    question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.</p>

                <p>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine
                    talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
                    subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted.
                    She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of
                    advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a
                    family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that
                    nothing was beneath this great lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of
                    dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of
                    questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the
                    least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her,
                    at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself,
                    whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been
                    educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt
                    all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly. </p>
